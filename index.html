                  <h3>
                    Instagram Story Time Limit Increased to 60 Seconds:
                  </h3></a
                >
                <p>
                  Instagram is reportedly increasing the time limit for
                  Instagram Stories to 60 seconds, from the earlier limit of 15
                  seconds. Previously, Instagram Stories that were longer than
                  15 seconds would be broken up into separate segments. The
                  social media company is said to have begun testing the change
                  with select users towards the end of last year. Earlier this
                  month, Instagram rolled out parental supervision tools and
                  Family Center in India. Meta had announced the parental
                  supervision tools and the Family Center tool back in March.
                  The company was recently slapped with EUR 405 million (roughly
                  Rs. 3,200 crore) fine for violating strict European Union data
                  privacy rules. According to a recent report by TechCrunch,
                  Instagram confirmed that it is increasing the time limit of
                  Instagram stories to 60 seconds from the earlier limit of 15
                  seconds. Previously, if a user had posted a video longer than
                  15 seconds, it used to get broken up into smaller segments.
                  This made the process of uploading videos to Instagram Stories
                  more challenging, including tagging and mentioning other
                  users. As mentioned earlier, Instagram is said to have begun
                  testing the new change with select users towards the end of
                  last year.

                  What is a blog? First, let's go over a brief history -- in
                  1994, Swarthmore College student Justin Hall is credited with
                  the creation of the first blog, Links.net. At the time,
                  however, it wasn't considered a blog … just a personal
                  homepage. In 1997, Jorn Barger, blogger for Robot Wisdom,
                  coined the term "weblog", which was meant to describe his
                  process for "logging the web" as he surfed the internet. The
                  term "weblog" was shortened to "blog" in 1999, by programmer
                  Peter Merholz. In the early stages, a blog was a personal web
                  log or journal in which someone could share information or
                  their opinion on a variety of topics. The information was
                  posted reverse chronologically, so the most recent post would
                  appear first. Nowadays, a blog is a regularly updated website
                  or web page, and can either be used for personal use or to
                  fulfill a business need. For instance, HubSpot blogs about
                  various topics concerning marketing, sales, and service
                  because HubSpot sells products related to those three subjects
                  -- so, more than likely, the type of readers HubSpot's blog
                  attracts are going to be similar to HubSpot's core buyer
                  persona. Alternatively, a woman named Kiki started a personal
                  travel blog, called The Blonde Abroad, to document her travel
                  experiences and provide readers with helpful tips and travel
                  recommendations. Her blog doesn't serve a larger company, but
                  it does help her create a personal brand. If a personal blog
                  is successful enough, the writer can also make money off of it
                  via sponsorships or advertisements. Take a look at 5
                  Strategies to Monetize a Blog to learn more. What is a blog
                  post? A blog post is an individual web page on your website
                  that dives into a particular sub-topic of your blog. For
                  instance, let's say you start a fashion blog on your retail
                  website. One blog post might be titled, "The Best Fall Shoes
                  for 2019". The post ties back to your overall blog topic as a
                  whole (fashion), but it also addresses a very particular
                  sub-topic (fall shoes). Blog posts allow you to rank on search
                  engines for a variety of keywords. In the above example, your
                  blog post could enable your business to rank on Google for
                  "fall shoes". When someone searches for fall shoes and comes
                  across your blog post, they have access to the rest of your
                  company's website. They might click "Products" after they read
                  your post, and take a look at the clothing items your company
                  sells. A blog post links back to your overall blog site. For
                  instance, right now, you're on
                  blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-a-blog. The
                  "what-is-a-blog" section of the URL is tied back to
                  /marketing/, which is the blog as a whole. Blog vs. Website A
                  blog is typically a section of your business's website -- but,
                  unlike the rest of your website, you need to update the blog
                  section frequently by adding new posts. Additionally, your
                  blog is a tool that allows you to engage more with an
                  audience, either by analyzing how many readers share your blog
                  posts on social, or by allowing readers to comment on your
                  individual posts. In this way, a blog is more like a two-way
                  conversation than the rest of your website. However, a blog
                  can also be an entire website, and often is, if the blog is
                  for personal use alone -- for instance, a travel blog. What is
                  a lifestyle blog? A lifestyle blog is a digital compilation of
                  an author's personal interests, daily activities, or opinions
                  on a subject. A lifestyle blog typically covers multiple
                  hobbies or talents of the writer, rather than focusing on one
                  subject alone. For instance, a lifestyle blog might include a
                  section for fashion, health and wellness, travel, and
                  relationships. A lifestyle blog is often highly personalized,
                  so it can often feel like you're reading a friend's curated
                  journal entries. There are plenty of benefits to blogging --
                  it helps drive traffic to your website, it enables you to
                  better convert that traffic into leads, it allows your
                  business to establish authority in an industry, and it
                  continues to help your business grow and attract new customers
                  months and even years after publication. To learn more about

                  between a wiki and a blog? A wiki is a collaborative space
                  where anyone who visits the site can edit, share, or publish
                  content -- Wikipedia is one of the most popular examples of
                  this. On the other hand, there is typically only one person,
                  or a team of people, with admin permissions to edit, share, or
                  publish to a blog. Website visitors who come across the blog
                  can potentially leave comments at the bottom of the blog post,
                  but they cannot publish to the site or edit the posted
                  material.....

                  There’s a fine line between coaching and mentoring. While many
                  people use the terms interchangeably, the two roles are
                  different, albeit with a lot of overlap. According to the
                  Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), “Coaching in a
                  business environment is a training method in which a more
                  experienced or skilled individual provides an employee with
                  advice and guidance intended to help develop the individual’s
                  skills, performance, and career.” SHRM also notes that
                  coaching is personalized, typically done one-on-one over a
                  period of time, and with a specific business objective in
                  mind. Mentoring, on the other hand, is a career development
                  method where a more junior professional is matched with a more
                  senior colleague through a formal or informal program. Mentors
                  guide mentees by sharing their own experiences, knowledge, and
                  expertise. Mentoring vs. Coaching — What’s the Difference?
                  Focus Mentoring and coaching differ mainly because of the type
                  of support or focus they provide to entrepreneurs. Coaches
                  help their clients by guiding them through specific points on
                  their journeys. For example, when you need help improving your
                  communication skills, or formulating a strategy to hit revenue
                  goals. The main aim is to improve your on-the-job performance.
                  Mentoring, on the other hand, is more driven by holistic
                  development. Perhaps you’ve met another business owner who has
                  been in the game a lot longer, and you admire what they’ve
                  built. Their mentorship allows you to use them as inspiration
                  for your own path. Mentors can provide expertise and
                  experience in your industry, or share their knowledge as
                  fellow entrepreneurs. Internalizing lessons from a trusted
                  mentor can lead to optimized decision-making and a quicker
                  path to success. Time frame....
